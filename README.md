## About

**yourIP** started as a simple web app to fulfill a common need I have of identifying my public IP without having
to use other methods to relay it back to me. This is half a purposeful tool and the other half a nice excuse to
learn some new things and deployment technologies.

### Built With

## Usage

### Development

Please see [Contributing](#contributing) for how to setup a dev environment

### Using the website

The current deployment of this tool is hosted and available to all online. You will have a couple choices for how you access
the website and what format your ask for the IP address to be returned in.

1. Point your browser to the official app URL at [https://yourip.app](https://yourip.app)
2. Use your favorite command line web tool (e.g. curl, wget) to access one of the two endpoints (raw or json)

   ```sh
   $ curl -L yourIP.app/json
   {
     "ip": "123.45.6.78"
   }
   ```

   ```sh
   $ curl -L yourIP.app/raw
   123.45.6.78
   ```
